## Q1. What Is an Algorithm? Explain Its Fundamental Steps Using the Example of Finding the Area of a Rectangle

An **algorithm** is a finite and well-defined set of sequenced instructions that, when executed, solve a specific problem or compute a desired result. Algorithms must be effective, unambiguous, and terminate after a finite number of steps.

**Fundamental Steps of Algorithm Design:**
1. **Problem Definition:** Clearly identify the inputs, outputs, and what needs to be achieved.
2. **Analysis:** Understand constraints, edge cases, and select appropriate data types.
3. **Design:** Develop a logical sequence of steps (can be in pseudocode, flowchart, or English).
4. **Implementation:** Convert the logical steps into a chosen programming language or executable pseudocode.
5. **Testing & Verification:** Ensure the algorithm is correct and efficient by applying it to various test cases.

**Example: Area of a Rectangle**

Suppose you are given a rectangle with length \( L \) and width \( W \). The area is calculated as \( \text{Area} = L \times W \).

**Pseudocode:**
Step 1: Read L, W
Step 2: Area ← L × W
Step 3: Print Area


**Flowchart:**


┌───────────┐
│ Start │
└─────┬─────┘
│
┌─────▼─────┐
│ Read L, W │
└─────┬─────┘
│
┌─────▼─────────┐
│ area = L × W │
└─────┬─────────┘

┌─────▼─────┐
│ Print area│
└─────┬─────┘

## Q2. Short Note on Algorithm with an Example

An **algorithm** is a precise sequence of instructions to solve a problem and must satisfy:
- **Finiteness:** Guarantees completion after a finite number of steps.
- **Definiteness:** Each operation is clearly and unambiguously specified.
- **Input/Output:** Accepts zero or more inputs and produces at least one output.
- **Effectiveness:** Operations are basic enough to be performed, in theory, by hand.
- **Generality:** Must solve all problems of a specified class.

**Example: Linear Search**

Linear search scans a list to find a target element.

**Pseudocode:**
for i from 1 to n do
if A[i] == X then
return i
return "Not Found"

text

**Diagram:**
Index: 0 1 2 3 4 (Array A)
Value:

Suppose X=8:
Start from index 0 → 2≠8, 5≠8, 7≠8, 8=8 (FOUND at index 3)

## Q3. Types of Complexity in Data Structures

When analyzing algorithms related to data structures, the following types of complexity are considered:

- **Time Complexity:** Measures the number of key operations/steps relative to the input size (not actual elapsed time). Expressed using Big O notation (e.g., O(n)).
- **Space Complexity:** Refers to extra memory required by the algorithm, aside from the input data.
- **Auxiliary Space:** Subset of space complexity; memory used for temporary variables, stacks (e.g., recursion stack).
- **Amortized Complexity:** Average time per operation, over a worst-case sequence of operations (e.g., array resizing in dynamic arrays).

**Diagram: Comparative Complexity (Conceptual)**
Input Size (n) →
│ Time Complexity: O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(n^2)
│ Space Complexity: Input Data + Extra/Temp Space
│ Amortized: Average over many operations

## Q4. Short Note on Complexity

**Algorithmic complexity** helps evaluate and compare algorithms based on resource usage.

- **Worst Case Complexity:** Max resource usage for any possible input.
- **Best Case Complexity:** Min resource usage for an ideal input.
- **Average Case Complexity:** Expected resource usage, averaged across all possible inputs.

**Why Complexity Matters:** 
Complexity lets us predict scalability and feasibility. It guides us to choose the most practical algorithm for the problem at hand.

## Q5. Five Fundamentals of Data Structures

1. **Abstraction:** Encapsulates internal details, exposing only operations to use the structure.
2. **Organization:** How data is laid out in memory (arrays are contiguous, linked lists are scattered).
3. **Operations:** Insertion, deletion, traversal, search, and update.
4. **Efficiency:** Evaluates performance (time and space) of various operations.
5. **Modularity:** Promotes code reusability by designing data structures as independent, modular components.

**Diagram: Linked List vs Array Layout**

Array: [A][B][C][D] (contiguous)
LinkedList: [A]->[B]->[C]->[D] (scattered in memory, each node points to the next)

## Q6. Different Types of Time Complexity

- **O(1):** Constant Time – Unaffected by input size (e.g., direct array access).
- **O(log n):** Logarithmic – Reduces problem size by a constant factor per step (e.g., binary search).
- **O(n):** Linear – Grows proportionally with input size (e.g., list traversal).
- **O(n log n):** Linearithmic – Typical for efficient sorts (e.g., merge sort, heap sort).
- **O(n²):** Quadratic – Nested loops (e.g., bubble sort).
- **O(2ⁿ), O(n!):** Exponential/Factorial – Brute force, impractical for large n.

**Diagram: Growth Rates (Conceptual)**
| *
| * * (O(n^2), O(2^n))
| * * * (O(n log n))
|* * (O(n))
|____*___________ n
O(1) O(log n) O(n) etc.

## Q7. Recursive Algorithm & Its Time Complexity

A **recursive algorithm** calls itself with smaller subproblems.

**Example: Factorial**
function fact(n):
if n == 0 then
return 1
else
return n × fact(n-1)

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) – One call per decrement until 0.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) – Due to recursion stack.

**Diagram: Recursion Tree for fact(4)**

fact(4)
|
└─> 4 × fact(3)
|
└─> 3 × fact(2)
|
└─> 2 × fact(1)
|
└─> 1 × fact(0)
|
└─> 1


---

## Q8. Non-Recursive Algorithm with Example

**Example: Iterative Factorial**
function fact_iter(n):
result ← 1
for i from 1 to n do
result ← result × i
return result

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (no recursion stack)

**Diagram: Iterative Accumulation (n=4)**

i=1: result=1×1=1
i=2: result=1×2=2
i=3: result=2×3=6
i=4: result=6×4=24
Final: result=24

## Q9. Short Note on Linked List

A **linked list** consists of nodes, each holding data and a pointer to the next node.

**Advantages:**
- Dynamic memory usage (no need for predefined size).
- Easy insertion/deletion at any position.

**Disadvantages:**
- Access time is linear (no direct access).
- Extra memory needed for pointers.

**Diagram: Singly Linked List**

[Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> [Data|Next] -> NULL
10 20 30

## Q10. Doubly Linked List with Diagram

A **doubly linked list** node contains pointers to both next and previous nodes.

**Node Structure:**

[Prev|Data|Next]

text

**Diagram:**
NULL ← ⇄ ⇄ → NULL

text
- `head.prev = NULL`
- `tail.next = NULL`

---

## Q11. Algorithm: Insert Node at Beginning of Doubly Linked List
procedure InsertAtBeginning(head, value):
newNode ← allocate Node
newNode.data ← value
newNode.prev ← NULL
newNode.next ← head
if head ≠ NULL then
head.prev ← newNode
head ← newNode
return head


**Diagram (Before and After Insertion):**

Before:
NULL ← ⇄

After inserting 10:
NULL ← ⇄ ⇄


---

## Q12. Algorithm: Delete Node from Beginning of Doubly Linked List

**Pseudocode:**

procedure DeleteAtBeginning(head):
if head = NULL then return NULL
toDelete ← head
head ← head.next
if head ≠ NULL then head.prev ← NULL
free(toDelete)
return head


**Diagram (Before and After Deletion):**

Before:
NULL ← ⇄ ⇄

After deleting 10:
NULL ← ⇄

## Q13. Algorithm: Insert Node at Given Position in Singly Linked List (with Diagram & Detailed Steps)

**Goal:** Insert a new node at a specified position (1-based index) in a singly linked list.

**Pseudocode:**
procedure InsertAtPosition(head, value, pos):
newNode ← allocate Node
newNode.data ← value
if pos = 1:
newNode.next ← head
head ← newNode
return head
temp ← head
for i from 1 to pos-2 do
if temp = NULL:
error "Position out of bounds"
temp ← temp.next
newNode.next ← temp.next
temp.next ← newNode
return head

text

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Allocate memory for the new node and assign its value.
2. If inserting at the very start (`pos=1`), link the new node to current head, update head.
3. Otherwise, traverse to the node just before the target position (`pos-1`), ensure the position is valid.
4. Insert by updating pointers: new node's next points to previous node's next, then update previous node's next to point to the new node.

**Diagram (Example: Insert 25 at position 2):**
Before:
→ → → NULL

After:
→ → → → NULL
Inserted at 2nd position

## Q14. Array vs. Linked List (5 Points Side-by-Side Table)

| Feature        | Array                   | Linked List                    |
|----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Memory         | Contiguous Allocation   | Dynamic, can grow/shrink       |
| Access         | O(1) direct (random)    | O(n) sequential                |
| Insertion      | Slow (shift elements)   | Fast at start/end (just pointers) |
| Size           | Fixed or Resizable      | Dynamic                        |
| Overhead       | No extra pointers       | Extra pointer(s) per node      |

**Diagram:**
Array: [A][B][C][D] (Memory is back-to-back)
LinkedList: [A]→[B]→[C]→[D] (Data scattered, linked by pointers)

## Q15. Circular Linked List with Diagram

A **circular linked list** is a variation where the last node points back to the first node, creating a loop.

**Diagram:**  
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+
| 10 | ---> | 20 | ---> | 30 |
+-------+ +-------+ +-------+
^ |
|______________________________|
(Last node points to head)

text

**Key Points:**
- No "NULL" at end; traversal can continue indefinitely if not careful.
- Useful for round-robin (cyclic) scheduling or buffer management.

---

## Q16. Delete Last Node in Singly Linked List (with Diagram & Steps)

**Pseudocode:**
procedure DeleteLast(head):
if head = NULL then return NULL
if head.next = NULL then
free(head); return NULL
temp ← head
while temp.next.next ≠ NULL do
temp ← temp.next
free(temp.next)
temp.next ← NULL
return head

text

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Check if the list is empty or has only one node.
2. Otherwise, traverse list until just before the last node.
3. Free (delete) last node and set previous node's `next` to NULL.

**Diagram:**
Before: → → → NULL
^ ^
| Last node to remove
After: → → NULL
(Now, 20 is tail)

## Q17. Explain Stack with Diagram

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (**LIFO**) principle. The most recently added element is removed first.

**Operations:**
- Push: Add item to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove item from the top.
- Peek: View topmost item without removing it.

**Diagram:**
+------+
| 30 | ← Top (last pushed, first popped)
+------+
| 20 |
+------+
| 10 |
+------+
(Bottom)

text

**Real-World Analogy:** Stack of plates in a cafeteria – take from top, add to top.

---

## Q18. Operations in Stack (with Explanation)

- **push(x):** Add an item `x` at the top.
- **pop():** Remove and return the item at the top; error if empty.
- **peek():** Return the item at the top without removing it.
- **isEmpty():** Returns true if stack is empty, else false.
- **isFull():** (Array stacks) Returns true if stack is at max capacity.

**All main operations (push, pop, peek) run in O(1) time.**

**Diagram: Push & Pop**
Initial Stack: empty

push(10): (top)
push(20): (top) →
push(30): (top) → →

pop(): removes 30, stack is now →

## Q19. Push and Pop Algorithms of Stack (with Stepwise View)

**Push:**
procedure push(stack, x):
if stack.top == stack.size-1 then
error "Overflow"
stack.top ← stack.top + 1
stack[stack.top] ← x

text
**Pop:**
procedure pop(stack):
if stack.top == -1 then
error "Underflow"
x ← stack[stack.top]
stack.top ← stack.top - 1
return x

text

**Stepwise View:**
> Start: stack = [], top = -1
>
> - push(10): top=0, stack=[10]
> - push(20): top=1, stack=[10, 20]
> - pop(): removes 20, top=0, stack=[10]

---

## Q20. Short Note on Stack

A **stack** is a versatile and fundamental linear data structure implementing the LIFO principle. All insertions and deletions occur at one end — the "top." Stacks are widely used for:
- **Function call management** (call stack stores return addresses/local vars for recursion).
- **Expression evaluation** (conversion or computation of postfix expressions).
- **Syntax parsing** and balancing of parentheses.
- **Undo features** in editors/applications (track user actions).

**Implementation:**  
- Array (fixed, fast; may face overflow)
- Linked list (dynamic size, no overflow but uses extra pointers)

**Operations:** All core stack actions complete in O(1) time, making stacks highly efficient for frequent add/remove scenarios.
